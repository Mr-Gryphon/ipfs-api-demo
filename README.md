ipfs-webpack demo
=====================

Quick demo on how to use node-ipfs-api together with webpack.

I had some issues getting it to work so this is just a sample demo.

Take a look here for the changes: https://github.com/VictorBjelkholm/webpack-node-ipfs-api-demo/commit/52f15301f81fddec9cc01bd84f2ad3b2a6b4923e

### To run

Start the daemon with `API_ORIGIN="*" ipfs daemon`

Run `npm install` and then `npm start` and the application should be running on `http://localhost:3000`
