ipfs-webpack demo
=====================

Quick demo on how to use node-ipfs-api together with webpack.

I had some issues getting it to work so this is just a sample demo.

### To run

Start the deamon with `API_ORIGIN="*" ipfs daemon`

Run `npm install` and then `npm run` and the application should be running on `http://localhost:3000`
